# Instructions

## Task

In this ungraded lab, your goal is to add an image from the `assets` folder that's already been added to the `src` folder. The image should be added into the App component, under the `h1` heading, inside the `return` statement.

## Steps

### **Step 1**

First, you need to import the image. The image should be referred to as `logo`.

### **Step 2**

Inside the `return` statement, add the new `img` element, with the `src` attribute set to the JSX expression evaluating the `logo` value, and the `alt` attribute holding the string of `"Logo"`.

### **Step 3**

Save and view your app in the browser.
